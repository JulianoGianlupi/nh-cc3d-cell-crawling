# This code implements a simple model of a 3D crawling fibrobast-like cell with a nucleus (NUCL), cytoplasm (CYTO) and lamellipodium (FRONT).
# The model for the cell uses a single diffusing chemical field (FActin) confined to the cell volume which represents the region of actin polarization in the cell.
# The chemical field obeys equation 10 in the text: \partial FActin / \partial t = D_F \nabla^2 FActin + k_source (if inside lamellipodium) - k_decay * FActin.
# The chemical field applies a repulsive chemotactic force of strength \lambda_F-actin (equation 9) to the boundary between lamellipodium and medium only.
# The cell starts migrating spontaneously after its shape symmetry is broken. 
# The trajectory of the cell is calculated and recorded, along with some information about the symmetry breaking state of the cell.
# The code was written between 2014-2015 mainly by I. Fortuna and Gilberto L. Thomas of the IFUFRGS, Brazil.
# The work is published in Biophysical Journal 118, 2801â€“2815, June 2, 2020 (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bpj.2020.04.024)
